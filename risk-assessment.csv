Security Risk Assessment,,,,,,,,
Risk #,Risk ,Risk Family,Control,Liklihood,Impact,Reasoning,Mitigating Controls,Total Risk Score
1,AES-128 encryption weak and easy to decipher,Data at Rest,VPC3 File storage only supports AES-128 Encryption,Medium,High,AES-128 is weak that the attacker can decipher it easily means the data in a risk of misuse.,Apply AES-256 for encryption,Medium
2,Database unencrypted in prdoction environment,Data in Transit,Databases in production are unencrypted,High,High,"Database store large amount of data with different classification, keep it unencrypted will make it easy target for the attackers which will affect CIA Triad badly.",Every database must be encrypted with AES-256,High
2b,Database unencrypted in prdoction environment,Data in Transit,Databases in production are unencrypted,High,High,"Database store large amount of data with different classification, keep it unencrypted will make it easy target for the attackers which will affect CIA Triad badly.",Every database must be encrypted with AES-257,High
3,Weak password,User Access,Internal network users require a 7-character password,Medium,High,Password with 7 characters only without complexity will be a very weak password that will be easy attack for crack or brute force attack,"Password must at least 8 characters including captial letters, small letter, numbers and special characters",Medium
4,No duration for the password,User Access,Passwords never expire,Medium,High,Password that never expire would be easier to guess and maybe can be a good target for brute force attack,Set duration for password either 60 or 90 days,Medium
5,MFA not applied with VPN access,User Access,VPN Access does not require MFA,Medium,High,"With only password, a VPN access maybe gained by an attacker if he/she successfully crack on of the user's password",Apply MFA for VPN access,Medium
6,Old weak version of TLS connection,Network Security,TLS V1.1 is used between the cloud production environment and SwiftTech���s physical lo,Medium,High,TLS V1.1 support SHA-1 which is no longer support and vulnerable to downgrade attack that will leads to affect the environment integrity ,Use TLS V1.2 as it is more secure and higher performance,Medium
7,Risk to Business Application Server,Vulnerability Management,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,Medium,High,"If the application development tier got hacked, there is a high risk that will affect the business application server too and it would be exposed",Application Development Tier and Business Application Server must be separated,Medium
7b,Risk to Business Application Server,Vulnerability Management,Application development Tiers are not logically segmented from Business Application servers,Medium,High,"If the application development tier got hacked, there is a high risk that will affect the business application server too and it would be exposed",Application Development Tier and Business Application Server must be separated,Medium
8,Development Teir Servers Vulnerabilities,Vulnerability Management,Development Tier servers are unpatched and contain multiple vulnerabilities,High,High,Unpatched server are easy target for attacker for hacking and expose which will lead to loss data and access to the system in event of ransomware for example, All servers must be patched and updated to avoid any vulnerability.,High
9,Application Code sent to Production environment without being scanned,Secure Code,Application code is not scanned for vulnerabilities before being published into production environment,High,High,Codes are sent to the production without any scan it is high potential to be exploited or gaining access to the system and information if any vulnerability discovered by an attacker ,Each code must be scann in the testing environment before send it to the production environment,High

Notes:,,,,,,,,
Risk - descriptions should be some reasonable approximation of what is written above but does not need to be exact,,,,,,,,
"Reasoning - The reasoning should approximately match to the user's assessment of the likelihood and impact of a potential risk.  If, for instance the likelihood and impact are marked high, the reasoning should reflect why it might be high",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Mitigating Controls - For the purpose of this exercise we did not include mitigating controls,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"Total Risk Score - Should not be less than a reasonable approximation of the likelihood x impact.  For instance, if L=High and I=High (and no mitigating control exists) then Risk cannot equal Low",,,,,,,,
